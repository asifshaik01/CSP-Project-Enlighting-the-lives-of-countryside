                    <p>Once a cradle of freedom struggle and resistance against British colonial rule, Nagaland’s Khonoma village today has a different identity, one that is equally pride-worthy. Enveloped within pristine terrace farms, this self-sustaining village of Nagaland is home to a 700-year-old Angami settlement and is considered to be India’s first green village.<br>
                        While managing to preserve its cultural heritage and ancestral roots, Khonoma’s community is focused on the conservation of its natural habitat, a cause that has led to the ban of all hunting activities in the village. Taking ownership of its ecosystem, the community here follows its own eco-friendly version of farming called Jhum agriculture, which is known to enrich the soil from within.</p>

                    <p>Every time a girl is born in this village, it calls for a celebration. And, to celebrate, the villagers plant a total of 111 trees in her honour. As she grows, the trees planted in her name are nurtured by the villagers to reach fruition. A symbolically rich gesture to overturn the gender-based discrimination and violence plaguing the state has now evolved into a positive wave in the last few years helping Piplantri village save girl children while improving its green cover.
                        To further support this cause, on the birth of a girl child, the panchayat sets up a fixed deposit for them while making their parents sign a legal affidavit to pledge to provide education for them.<br>
                        In the last 14 years, the villagers have planted almost a million trees on the common grazing land. Like each girl who is nurtured and supported, the community is also striving to help these trees survive and so to protect them from pests like termites, the villagers have also planted over 2.5 million aloe vera plants around the trees. These afforestation efforts have also helped boost livelihood for the village residents.</p>

Not only does this village generate electricity for its use, but it also sells power to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. Having attained acclaim in this regard they launched another project worth Rs 5 crore to install wind and solar energy farms. This project, among its several other welfare and energy independence initiatives, is helping over 8,000 residents live prosperous lives.</p>

Surprisingly, since 1995, this village has managed to survive without the need to depend on a single water tanker.<br>
                        A village that once experienced an acute water crisis with negligible annual rainfall, decided to take a stand to change its course. Back in 1995, the villages decided to give up farming water-intensive crops and instead focused on horticulture and dairy farming. This decision in conjunction with many water conservation efforts helped raise the groundwater levels and ensured prosperity. With almost 300 open wells brimming with water, the village is home to 60 millionaires and the highest per capita income in the country, all reflective of the prosperity they have managed to achieve.</p>

                    <p>So as to make village to move towars development I have chose devis peta village as mywork area .<b>In the 1st week </b>,I took permission from vro and sarpanch of the village.Then i started conducting survey in the village to know about the village the problems being faced by the villagers.
                        <br> <b>In the 2nd week</b>, I continued my survey and was able to conclude that most of the villagers were dependent on agriculture and aquaculture.I also got to know that some of the villagers were on to bussiness.
                        <br><b>In the 3rd week</b>, For the first half of the week i survryed in the village about other problems of the village.Villagers informed me about the decrement of water levels from past few years<br>
                        In the second half of the 3rd week ,I started awareness program about various modern techniques in agriculture and also on water restoration techniques.
                        <br><b>In the 4th week</b>,as it is the week of problem identification ,i started finding the major problems of the village .I found most of the fields were effected by some kind of virus and the crops were destroyed.Later , I figured out it to be mosaic virus.Also i found some dry ponds in the village area as a mirror for deceremented water levels in devis peta.                    
                        <br>After figuring out the problems in the previous week <b>In the 5th week</b>,I researched on the internet and found how to prevent mosaic virus and to conserve water.Then,I conducted awareness program again , and explained the villagers about the solutions to their problems.Thus i was successful in finding the solution and implementing it
                        <br><b>And after that me and my team wanted to develop a website addressig the problems of the villagers and how to condemn them</b>

                    <p>The usage of plastic was high in devis peta village . So i amd my team organized anti-plastic awareness programme.
                        We explained the villagers about the hazards that plastic poses to the environment . We discussed the replacement of plastic i.e.,
                        jute bags instead of plastic covers , using pottery tools as containers rather than plastic containers etc.
                        Thus we were able to aware the people about the threat of plastic to the environment and the alternatives of plastics.

                    <p>To tackle depletion of ground water level , we conducted another awareness programme on the ways of increasing the ground water level.
                        We observed that mostly the people were using bore wells for domestic as well as for irrigation purpose.
                        So , we suggested them to limit the usage of water by bore wells instead we promoted the use of wells for domestic purpose
                        and canals for irrigation . we also suggested people too build the storage tanks and ponds to prevent the drought situation.

                    <p>The serious problem which I found in work area is the infected crops due to mosaic virus.I surfed through the internet and found
                        that implementing organic farming could make the crops grow better and less infected . So ,I and my team conducted a drive addressing 
                        the solution to virus spreaded crops . As a result , later some crops were protected from the virus . We also promoted modern irrigtion techniques 
                        such as "drip irrigation" technique etc. Thus we were able to make the people move towards prosperity through make some good yield and further 
                        making a good profit.
